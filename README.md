# InterpreteurCpp

This repo is a school project where we had to create an interpretor and transpiler for a new language by pairs.
The base code (Initial commit) was given by our school.

The code has memory leaks as we never `delete` pointers. This is intended as it would have been easier to handle it with smart pointers but we didn't learn how to use them yet. That should be a vector of improvement.

*The majority of the code is written in French as it is our main language. Understanding it may be harder without knowledge of the French language.*
